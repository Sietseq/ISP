This project aims to scrape data from X (formerly known as Twitter) to identify trending topics across time periods. Visualizing the change in popularity of certain topics provides insight into public discourse. These trends can be used to assist marketing decisions, explain human behaviour, and even provide political analysis.

Note: The dataset has not been made yet. This is one of the main parts to the project HPC portion.
